This program creates a pack of cards, has the ability to shuffle them with 2 options of shuffling algorithm to choose from (Riffle and Fisher-Yates) and then can deal cards to the user (multiple or single)

The Testing.cs file is used to Test the program to see if it works as intended, a test is disabled by default, and must be enabled through the Program.cs file by removing the // before the command that calls the test.
